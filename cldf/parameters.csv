M. (1981). A grammar of Lower Grand Valley Dani. Pacific Linguistics, C-63, pp. 399-408.",© H. M. Bromley,NA,whole,"The original text gives five annotation layers (for details see Bromley (1981, p. 399): 1) the Dani text in Latin orthography, 2) a line with abbreviations identifying participants of the narrated story, 3) a ""parsing code"" for verbs which describes them in terms of the categories defined in the grammatical chapters, 4) running glosses (which, however lack some of the information that is given in the parsing code), 5) a free translation. We here only give 1), 4) and 5) respectively, since the other two annotation layers are not understandable without further extensive explanations of abbreviations and conventions. Also, the original glosses contain simple hyphens <-> and double hyphens <-->. As far as we can tell, the former correspond to <.> in the Leipzig glossing rules, i.e. indicating that a single Dani word form is represented by several English word forms; whereas the latter corresponds to <-> in the Leipzig glossing rules, i.e. to a genuine morpheme boundary. Hence, we replace <-> by <.> and <--> by <-> in the glossings. Furthermore, the glossings sometimes contain explanations in parentheses, which are here given as footnotes. Parentheses which are given within a word form in the glossing are also given as footnote marked <x> within the word form.
